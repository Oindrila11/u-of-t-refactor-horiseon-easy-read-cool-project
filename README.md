# Horiseon Social Solution Services
The website for horiseon social solution services provides people opportunity to improve seo, increase networking through different social media platforms. 

Initially the website had couple of problems that could negatively impact the look and accessibility standards of the website. I wanted to work on the website in order to make the website accessible and to improve seo. 

In order to achieve that, firstly I changed the background color of the header and added color to footer to make those sections stand out. I also changed the background color for the benefit section on the side to give a cohesive look to the entire website.

Added alt attribute to the icons on the left inside the benefit section for accessibility purpose.

Used semantic html tags to make the both html and css file look more organised. 

The pourpose of this project was to make the website accessible and improve seo. The newer version of the website does satisfy the purpose. However I wanted to add a section where the customers can interact through the website by providing their information which I plan to add in future.

As a new web developer there were couple of challanges that I faced while making the changes ; picking the appropriate image to add the alt atrribute was one of them. 

I think the color co-ordination of the website and the more organised code make my website different than others.
